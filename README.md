## Usage

- Place the [packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/releases/tag/v0.0.3) in the root directory for your server
- Use `/packwizsu link [URL]` to link to your `pack.toml` file

If you do not own the physical server yourself please check with your hosting provider that they will allow custom startup arguments to be executed and download files remotely using packwiz. If you aren't sure just send a link to this mod in a support ticket.
